# MCP Architecture Overview

## Introduction

MyCryptoProtocol (MCP) is designed as a protocol-level framework for connecting AI agents with crypto-native services. This document outlines the architectural components and their interactions.

## High-Level Architecture

MCP consists of five main components:

1. **Registry Layer** - On-chain registry of agents, contexts, and permissions
2. **Agent Layer** - AI-powered agents that process instructions and execute actions
3. **Context Layer** - Services and data sources that agents interact with
4. **Execution Layer** - Transaction execution and metering
5. **Bridge Layer** - Connections between on-chain and off-chain components

## Registry Layer

The Registry Layer maintains the on-chain record of all agents, contexts, and permissions in the MCP ecosystem. It consists of Solana programs that handle:

- Agent registration and management
- Context registration and discovery
- Permission granting and verification
- Authority designation and validation

The Registry serves as the source of truth for the protocol, ensuring that agents can only access contexts they have permission for.

## Agent Layer

Agents are specialized AI entities that can process natural language instructions and execute actions on behalf of users. Each agent:

- Has a specific domain expertise (e.g., DeFi, NFTs)
- Can parse natural language into structured actions
- Manages execution flow and decision-making
- Interacts with appropriate contexts to fulfill tasks

Agents are modular and can be composed or extended to handle complex workflows.

## Context Layer

Contexts represent services or data sources that agents can interact with. Each context:

- Exposes a defined set of capabilities
- Provides standardized interfaces for specific domains
- Can be on-chain or off-chain services
- Has configurable permission requirements

Examples include DEXes, NFT marketplaces, oracles, and social platforms.

## Execution Layer

The Execution Layer handles transaction execution and resource metering:

- Tracks agent activity and resource usage
- Provides execution receipts and auditing
- Handles transaction assembly and submission
- Manages execution flow across multiple contexts

## Bridge Layer

The Bridge Layer connects on-chain components with off-chain services:

- Translates protocol messages to service-specific formats
- Handles authentication and credentials
- Manages state synchronization
- Provides fallback mechanisms

## Security Considerations

The architecture incorporates several security measures:

- On-chain permission verification
- Execution metering to prevent abuse
- Authority-based access control
- Credential isolation between contexts
- Transaction simulation before execution

## Extensibility

MCP is designed to be extensible through:

- New agent implementations
- Additional context integrations
- Custom execution patterns
- Protocol-level governance
- Token-based incentive mechanisms
